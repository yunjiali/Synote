[Synote](http://synote.org)
=================

Synote is a multimedia annotation system based on Web 2.0 and emerging Web 3.0 (semantic Web and linked data). In Synote note, you can:

* Listen to recordings whilst viewing the transcript and slides and making synchronised notes.
* Annotate only a certain part of audio-visual resources from all over the Web and share them online. 
* Automatically publish media fragments and annotations using Linked Data and they are searchable by Google. 
* Transcripts can be automatically uploaded via speech recognition if linked to this type of service (only for users of University of Southampton).

It's created and maintained by Yunjia Li,Dr Mike Wald and EA Draffan at Web and Internet Science Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton.

* Linking user generated annotations, including comments and transcripts into the linked data cloud using Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation ([NERD](http://nerd.eurecom.fr))
* Add support for mobile and tablet devices, especially audio and video replay
* Use Twitter Bootstrap to optimise user interface for mobile and tablet
